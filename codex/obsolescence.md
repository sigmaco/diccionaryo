# Term: obsolescence

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Obsolescence** is the process or state by which a unit of meaning, system, tool, or behavior loses semantic, practical, or ethical viability within its operational context. In **Logotecture**, it refers to the **justified decommissioning** of such units, typically through a formal review of their failure to support accuracy, fairness, coherence, or applicability.

**Domain**: language systems, epistemology, culture, institutional design, technology  
**Forms**: obsolescence (n), obsolete (adj), obsoleting (v), obsolesce (v)

**Depends on**:

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Structured Departure**: Obsolescence is **managed**, not accidental. It triggers review, decision, and either **deprecation** or **archival**.

- **Semantic Lifespan Awareness**: Words, norms, systems have lifespans. Obsolescence is part of a language‚Äôs **maintenance logic**, not its weakness.

- **Audit-Triggered**: In Logotecture, a term or construct becomes *eligible* for obsolescence after review for **loss of accuracy, misuse, cultural shift, or ethical violation**.

- **Can Be Partial**: A word may be **partially obsolete**‚Äîits core remains, but it loses certain meanings or forms due to drift or abuse (e.g., politically hijacked terms).

### üîç Governance Notes

- **Not Erasure**: Obsolescence does not equal deletion. It may lead to **archival** (retaining for historical traceability) or **forking** (creating a new version with clarified function).

- **Must Be Logged**: Any deprecation or replacement must be recorded, with justification traceable to prior definitions or decision trees.

- **Prevents Distortion**: By formally recognizing obsolescence, Logotecture blocks the **zombie-life** of terms that have been emptied or reversed in meaning due to ideological or commercial hijack.

- **Enables Progress**: Innovation without clear retirement of obsolete structures leads to confusion, semantic pollution, and incoherence.

### üîç Why This Matters in Practice

- **Law and Governance**: Obsolete legal terms create ambiguity and allow for opportunistic reinterpretation. Logging obsolescence improves justice clarity.

- **Civic Language**: Many cultural and institutional terms (e.g., ‚Äúcharity,‚Äù ‚Äúminority,‚Äù ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù) are used with outdated assumptions. Obsolescence review helps society **refactor discourse**.

- **AI Interpretation**: For machines to interpret language responsibly, they must **know what no longer applies** and why. Obsolescence feeds semantic hygiene in AI governance.

### üîç Related Actions

- **Deprecation**: Public flagging of reduced use with recommendation against continued usage.  
- **Archival**: Storage of a deprecated or obsolete concept for reference, not active use.  
- **Refactoring**: Semantic or structural revision to replace or re-align outdated units.  
- **Forking**: Creating a distinct new term or system from a broken or overloaded one.
